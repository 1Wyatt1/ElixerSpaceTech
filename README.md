# ElixerSpaceTech

**__Elixer Programming Team__**

The team at Elixer have worked extremely hard to create a functional, stable, and easy to read open source script, which contains Elixers launch & landing sequence.

The code is free to use, however if you include it in a YouTube video, please [click here](https://discord.gg/ukGAYUF) to gain permission from the **Chief Programmer**

***__Current Version - 0.8__***

The current version will be updated frequently to suit the rockets we use, and to smoothen the launch & landing sequence.
